 toi_roman_invasion.0002.desc:0 "Traders and travellers bring tales of a powerful empire.\n\nAfter years of fighting, these men called Romans have pacified the tribes and created the province of Britannia. They claim they are bringing civilization and order, while plundering the land and enslaving the locals. They are respected and feared in equal measure.\n\nGreat roads, fortresses and infrastructure have been created by their soldier engineers known as Legionnaires, but only for Roman gain. They are satisfied now, but it's only a matter of time before they hunger again.\n\nNeither the east nor the west has been able to satisfy them.

Even now there are whispers of conspiracy and uprisings as the regional governors struggle to maintain order."
