 cattle.0001.t: "Cow Market"
 cattle.0001.desc: "As I wander through the cow market, I see a magnificent beast: the most beautiful cow I have ever seen. Even better, the merchant is selling it for next to nothing.\n\nThis cow looks like it could produce a prodigious amount of milk and mother many calves. Purchasing it could help me expand my herd."
 cattle.0001.a: "A blessing from the gods, I would be foolish not to seize it!"
 cattle.0001.b: "No, my herd is large enough as it is."
 cattle.0001.c: "What's that? You haven't heard of the new cow tax? Not to worry, dear merchant, I'll just take this one and we can call it even."

 cattle.0002.desc: "As I am walking through my realm on an ordinary day I see, from afar, some white specks wandering across a nearby hill.\n\nUpon approaching the hill I can see them better now; they are sheep, and there are many of them.

 cattle.0003.t: "The Special Bull"
 cattle.0003.desc: "A new bull was born in my land. At first he looked like any other bull, but a few days later he began to grow astonishingly fast.\n\nHe is now both the biggest and most fertile bull I own. My courtiers expressed concern that a bull growing this fast will surely have a shorten life span, and it would be in my best interest to sell it for a tidy sum while I still can."
 cattle.0003.a: "This is MY bull you fool!"
 cattle.0003.b: "Maybe they're right, I should try to profit from this occasion."
 cattle.0003.c: "Maybe I could take advantage of the situation."

 cattle.0004.desc: "A rumour has swept through the ring fort: one of my champions has supposedly discovered a magical spring.\n\nThe water from this spring will keep you and your herd hale and hearty,” he explains.\n\nThe source of this water is far away and the trip might be risky, and I can’t know for sure if the water is really magical. If this is a trick, this expedition could cost a lot and gain me nothing."

 cattle.0004.b: "I'm not risking my time and my money for water."
 cattle.00041.t: "The blessed water"
 cattle.00041.desc: "We have walked for days through forests, hills, plains, and bogs. We approach a lake with water so blue, I could swear the sky itself had pooled upon the earth.\n\n“This is it!” shouts my champion, “this is it!”\n\nAs we approach the lake, buckets and flasks at the ready, we are suddenly attacked by a monstrous creature. An enraged beast, seemingly half dog and half otter, emerges with fangs bared."

 cattle.00042.t: "Water of Deceitfulness"
 cattle.00042.desc: "We have walked for days through forests, hills, plains, and bogs. We approach a paltry, swampy lake. It looks quite ordinary.\n\n“Here it is,” says my champion.\n\nWe have spent hours around this lake, searching for something marvellous or magical… but nothing seems to stand out."
 cattle.00042.a: "Let’s take some of this water nonetheless; we never know."

 cattle.0005.t: "Fire! Fire! Fire!"
 cattle.0005.desc: "Tonight I have been woken up by the screams of my servants. Screams every lord dreads to hear.\n\nFire.\n\nWhere? Where did the fire start?\n\nNobody knows where it began, but it ended with our farms in smoldering ruins."
 cattle.0005.a: "From ashes to ashes… Loss is everyone's lot, highborn or peasant."
 cattle.0005.b: "The gods have punished us. We must redeem ourselves with great sacrifices."
 cattle.0005.c: "Traitors! My fort is full of traitors! We will find the coward responsible for this!"
 cattle.0006.t: "Surprise From My Steward"
 cattle.0006.desc: "That bumbling fool! My steward has taken the initiative to invite my vassals, friends and guests to a big feast.

 cattle.0006.a: "It’s too late to do anything, let’s enjoy the feast."

 cattle.0007.t: "Wolves!"
 cattle.0007.desc: "Some of my livestock has been disappearing, and one of my herdsman has just found the mangled corpse of an ewe, clearly mauled by wolves.\n\nHunting wolves is never an easy task; we must track them, spot them, and attack without risking the lives of my people. It won't be easy, but we must dispose of this threat to our sheep and cattle.\n\n“My lord, how would you like to proceed?” asks my best hunter.”"
 cattle.0007.a: "We must act fast."
 cattle.0007.a.success: "The beast is defeated!"

 cattle.0008.t: "Farmer Going Away"
 cattle.0008.desc: "One of my councillors approaches me, his face grim.\n\nHe explains to me that one of the free farmers of the realm has decided to leave in order to join his family in other lands. Usually these departures are replaced quickly with newcomers and are a minor clerical matter; this time, however, it is different. This particular farmer possesses a large amount of the realm's cattle. If he leaves, the growth and economy of my lands will slow."
 cattle.0008.a: "I am not above the laws of the gods. He has the right to leave and I will respect his will."
 cattle.0008.b: "We should try to make our lands more attractive to avoid this in the future."

 cattle.2001.t: "New Fertilizer"
 cattle.2001.desc: "For the past few months I have been working on making a new mixture of fertilizer using chunks of chalk. My results so far have been encouraging, giving me hope that this fertilizer will allow us to feed more cattle.\n\nThis morning I've finally come to present some of my farmers with my new creation. “Are you sure this will work, my lord?” one of them asked. “If you are wrong we might end up losing some of this year's harvest.”"

 cattle.2002.t: "Poisoned Animals"
 cattle.2002.desc: "“The animals… they have been poisoned by dark magic or some sort of evil spirit. Most of them are sick my lord, and I fear many of them won't make it.”\n\nAs if the news wasn't bad enough, seeing the animals with my own eyes sends shivers down my spine. Certainly some will survive, but many will no doubt perish. A chieftain's power and his herd are inextricably intertwined; if I can't solve this, what kind of chieftain am I?\n\nI must think. How will I approach this?"
 cattle.2002.a: "I will not sleep until we have a cure for these poor animals."

 cattle.2003.t: "Bull Exchange"
 cattle.2003.desc: "As I wander the market, I come across a magnificent bull for sale. The merchant is quick to tell me his story: supposedly the man has visited every corner of our island, and claims to have even visited the mythical island of Hy-Brasil. After he is done relating his past, I ask him what he wants in exchange for the bull.\n\nHe looks pleased to have a buyer. “In truth I need a bull that's a bit less spirited; this one nearly destroyed my boat on my last voyage! But he is a fine beast, and I'd not part with him without a bit of gold…”"
 cattle.2003.a: "I will offer two calmer bulls in exchange for his beast."
 cattle.2003.a.success: "The deal is done."
 tooltip.cattle.2003.a.success: "This magnificent bull is mine!"

 cattle.2004.t: "Gift for a Ceremony"
 cattle.2004.desc: "A union between two of my subjects is being celebrated today within the halls of my fort. The mood is merry, the mead is flowing, and a fili regales us with tales of our ancestors and heroes while we feast.\n\nI realise that I've been so distracted by the festivities I've forgotten to offer a gift to the new couple. As [CHARACTER.GetPrimaryTitle], I naturally can afford a more handsome gift than the commoners; indeed, it is tradition to offer something from my herd."
 cattle.2004.a: "As I bestow my personal blessing upon this union, so shall I bestow a gift of cattle."
 cattle.2004.b: "I happily give them my blessing, but surely they'd prefer gold over cows?"

 cattle.2004.c: "I am not going to waste the realm's resources on commoners!"
 cattle.2005.t: "New Land Repartition"
 cattle.2005.desc: "Today is a very important day. My most influential farmers have assembled in my ringfort, ready to discuss the redistribution of the realm's land and animals for the coming years. These meetings are just as political as they are practical.\n\nThe farmers begin with the less controversial task by exchanging some of their livestock to form the most productive herds. Once done, they look to me for the announcement of what shall become of [CHARACTER.GetPrimaryTitle.GetAdjective]'s land.\n\nWhatever I decide here will impact greatly the lives of my people and thus their perception of me as [CHARACTER.GetPrimaryTitle]. I must choose carefully."

 cattle.2006.a: "Killing a sheep is offending the gods, it should be punished."
 cattle.2006.b: "The sheep should be guarded, it’s not the dog fault."
 cattle.2006.c: "The problem is not who’s fault is it, the problem is the walls around the field, we should plan to rebuilt them."
