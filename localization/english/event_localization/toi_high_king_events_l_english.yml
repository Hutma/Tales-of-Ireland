 toi_highking_event.0001.desc:0 "The High Kingship is not always greatly influential, but I have been fortunate enough to find widespread approval of my rule, and many tribes have agreed to pay tribute. Some of the most powerful families have even sent me lavish gifts, expressing their gratitude for the peace and stability my reign has brought the land. Not many High Kings can claim to have received such an honor, and the tokens of their support have filled me with a sense of pride and accomplishment. \n\nThe coming day is packed with audiences and endless council meetings, but my mood is light as I sit down on the throne and see the smiling faces of my courtiers and vassals."
