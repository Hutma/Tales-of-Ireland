 toi_pictish_invasion.0001.desc:0 "Most Picts dwell in the Scottish Highlands, a wild and dangerous place with impassable mountains, ferocious animals and harsh weather. There's also many Sidhe that hate all beings who walk on two legs or lack wings.\n\nWith the subjugation of the Lowland Picts, the passage has opened for raiders to take Pictish treasures from up north. Word is spreading of the Highland Clans uniting and preparing to march on Alba!"

 toi_pictish_invasion.0002.desc:0 "Sources in the northern frontiers spread word of hordes painted in blue and armed to the teeth marching south. They will wash over the Lowlands like a flood, destroying all in their path. How far will they get before meeting an army that stops them?\n\nWe're not sure if they're here to avenge the loss of their brothers or simply replace them as new kings. Either way, all of Alba will feel their wrath."
