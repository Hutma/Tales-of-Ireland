#Sacrifice to sidhe

 toi_decisions.010.desc:0 "Long ago, our ancestors travelled to the Otherworld, home of the powerful spirits known as Sidhe. They learned how Sidhe magic subtly influences the world and guides its people, and showing respect and devotion to them yields great rewards. It is now time to renew our bond in a great ceremony.\n\nOur druids have sang chants and carved sacred runes into the ground. This delicate ritual opens a path to the Otherworld, and the air becomes enchanted with strange and mystical power. \n\nColours become vivid, the sound dies down and time slows to a crawl. We have caught the Sidhe’s attention, and now they await my offering to them.\n\nHow much shall I give?"
