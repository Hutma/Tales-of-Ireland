 toi_wolfwalker.0001.desc:0 "For ages, stories have been told about wolves who walk on two legs. One week ago, reports have arisen that they have been spotted around certain ringforts in my country. If they were tracked down, we could understand them, and determine whether an alliance or extermination would be safer for our herds"
 toi_wolfwalker.0001.a:0 "The ancient tales will guide me to their location." 
 toi_wolfwalker.0001.b:0 "I shall hunt them down as the beasts they are." 
 
 toi_wolfwalker.0002.t:0 "The Den"
 toi_wolfwalker.0002.desc:0 "At last, my efforts have come to fruition. One wolf strayed into the eyes of one of our scouts, and was followed to its den. The seeming multitude of wolves are hidden by deep vegetation and plant cover, providing near invisibility to the den. Now that the den has been sighted, we must decide our next move"
 toi_wolfwalker.0002.a:0 "I will sneak in alone, so as to not draw attention."
 toi_wolfwalker.0002.b:0 "I will call my knights and flush them out."
 toi_wolfwalker.0002.c:0 "I shall watch from a distance, to better understand them."
 toi_wolfwalker.0002.d:0 "We have seen all we can, to proceed is unnecessary risk."
 
 toi_wolfwalker.0003.t:0 "Failed to spot the wolves"
 toi_wolfwalker.0003.desc:0 "My Scouts and I have searched the forest for any clue of these wolves, but have seen no proof of their existence. Every rumor heard, seems to be nothing at all, or a simple bear. Perhaps they are as skilled as legends claim."
 toi_wolfwalker.0003.a:0 "We must withdraw for now, but keep our ears to the ground for more news."
 
 toi_wolfwalker.0004.t:0 "Into the Den"
 toi_wolfwalker.0004.desc:0 "As the wolves move away from their den to hunt I tried to sneak into it. I took every precaution to make sure I'll go undetected even if there are wolves still in the den.\n\nI explored the den and indeed there are a few wolves prowling inside the den. Eventually I reach the inner sanctum of the den. There, I can see a woman sleeping, along with dozens of wolves. Is the leader of the wolves human?"
 toi_wolfwalker.0004.a:0 "Now is the time to attack and kill the leader!"
 toi_wolfwalker.0004.b:0 "Maybe I should talk to her first, I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation."
 toi_wolfwalker.0004.c:0 "It seems to be too dangerous, I better give up."
 
 toi_wolfwalker.0101.t:0 "The Wolfwalkers"
 toi_wolfwalker.0101.desc:0 "As I start to speak, the woman jumps, seemingly fearing of what I would do. Trying to speak, I am drowned out by the howling and baying of the wolves, and the woman seems angry at me being here. While I am still speaking, a man appears from a side cavern, demanding to know what has happened. When he sees me, he promptly collapses, and a giant ethereal wolf rises out of his body, and plants himself in protection of the woman."
 toi_wolfwalker.0101.a:0 "They must listen to me!"
 toi_wolfwalker.0101.b:0 "I can now strike them at their source!"
 toi_wolfwalker.0101.c:0 "Time to run!"
