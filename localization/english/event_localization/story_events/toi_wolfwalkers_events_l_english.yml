 toi_wolfwalker.0001.t:0 "The Wolfwalkers"
 toi_wolfwalker.0001.desc:0 "For ages, stories have been told about wolves who walk on two legs. One week ago, reports have arisen that they have been spotted around certain ringforts in my country. If they were tracked down, we could understand them, and determine whether an alliance or extermination would be safer for our herds"
 toi_wolfwalker.0001.a:0 "The ancient tales will guide me to their location." 
 toi_wolfwalker.0001.b:0 "I shall hunt them down as the beasts they are." 
 
 toi_wolfwalker.0002.t:0 "The Den"
 toi_wolfwalker.0002.desc:0 "At last, my efforts have come to fruition. One wolf strayed into the eyes of one of our scouts, and was followed to its den. The seeming multitude of wolves are hidden by deep vegetation and plant cover, providing near invisibility to the den. Now that the den has been sighted, we must decide our next move"
 toi_wolfwalker.0002.a:0 "I will sneak in alone, so as to not draw attention."
 toi_wolfwalker.0002.b:0 "I will call my knights and flush them out."
 toi_wolfwalker.0002.c:0 "I shall watch from a distance, to better understand them."
 toi_wolfwalker.0002.d:0 "We have seen all we can, to proceed is unnecessary risk."
 
 toi_wolfwalker.0003.t:0 "Failed to spot the wolves"
 toi_wolfwalker.0003.desc:0 "My Scouts and I have searched the forest for any clue of these wolves, but have seen no proof of their existence. Every rumor heard, seems to be nothing at all, or a simple bear. Perhaps they are as skilled as legends claim."
 toi_wolfwalker.0003.a:0 "We must withdraw for now, but keep our ears to the ground for more news."
 
 toi_wolfwalker.0004.t:0 "Into the Den"
 toi_wolfwalker.0004.desc:0 "As the wolves move away from their den to hunt I tried to sneak into it. I took every precaution to make sure I'll go undetected even if there are wolves still in the den.\n\nI explored the den and indeed there are a few wolves prowling inside the den. Eventually I reach the inner sanctum of the den. There, I can see a woman sleeping, along with dozens of wolves. Is the leader of the wolves human?"
 toi_wolfwalker.0004.a:0 "Now is the time to attack and kill the leader!"
 toi_wolfwalker.0004.b:0 "Maybe I should talk to her first, I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation."
 toi_wolfwalker.0004.c:0 "It seems to be too dangerous, I better give up."
 
 toi_wolfwalker.0005.t:0 "Failed to sneak in!"
 toi_wolfwalker.0005.desc:0 "As I try to sneak into the den, I trip on a rock and fall on the floor... \n\nThe noise created by the fall alerted all the wolves nearby, and now I'm surrounded by those human-eaters. \n\nI can see the path to the exit of the den can be reached if I'm able to kill some of the wolves."
 toi_wolfwalker.0005.a:0 "Fight to escape!"
 toi_wolfwalker.0005.b:0 "I surrender!"
 
 toi_wolfwalker.0006.t:0 "Reinforcements are here"
 toi_wolfwalker.0006.desc:0 "After a while, the retinue I called to assist me forms ranks in front of me. They are eager to prove their worth, and wish for a head-on assault."
 toi_wolfwalker.0006.a:0 "Chaaaaaarge!"
 toi_wolfwalker.0006.b:0 "Let's light a fire, we aren't taking any chances."
 toi_wolfwalker.0006.c:0 "I don't think we should do anything actually."
 
 toi_wolfwalker.0007.t:0 "Hiden and observing"
 toi_wolfwalker.0007.desc:0 "I decided to lie in wait for them, to observe their behavior. It took nearly a full day to see any sign of the wolves. When I did, it was a full pack of wolves, with a large wolf at its center, seemingly leading it."
 toi_wolfwalker.0007.a:0 "This is my opportunity to strike!"
 toi_wolfwalker.0007.b:0 "I will continue to observe, I need more information."
 toi_wolfwalker.0007.c:0 "This is too dangerous, I will leave them be"
 
 toi_wolfwalker.0101.t:0 "The Wolfwalkers"
 toi_wolfwalker.0101.desc:0 "As I start to speak, the woman jumps, seemingly fearing of what I would do. Trying to speak, I am drowned out by the howling and baying of the wolves, and the woman seems angry at me being here. While I am still speaking, a man appears from a side cavern, demanding to know what has happened. When he sees me, he promptly collapses, and a giant ethereal wolf rises out of his body, and plants himself in protection of the woman."
 toi_wolfwalker.0101.a:0 "They must listen to me!"
 toi_wolfwalker.0101.b:0 "I can now strike them at their source!"
 toi_wolfwalker.0101.c:0 "Time to run!"
 
 toi_wolfwalker.0102.t:0 "The Wolfwalkers judgement"
 toi_wolfwalker.0102.desc:0 "After my surrender, I expected to be slaughtered without mercy, but instead the two leaders start howling, and this calms the remaining wolves. These larger wolves prowl around me, then retreat to a side cave. A few minutes later, two humans approach from the same side cave, and say “We will convene to decide your fate. Wait here” \n\nThey then both retreat further down the main cave."
 toi_wolfwalker.0102.a:0 "I will wait as commanded."
 toi_wolfwalker.0102.b:0 "I must escape!"
 
 toi_wolfwalker.0103.t:0 "Burning the den"
 toi_wolfwalker.0103.desc:0 "We have the kindling set, the oil thrown, and the pitch ready. The only remaining task is to enact the plan. We must burn the front first so as to provide no escape."
 toi_wolfwalker.0103.a:0 "Light the Torches!"
 
 toi_wolfwalker.0104.t:0 "Hiden and observing"
 toi_wolfwalker.0104.desc:0 "It has been nearly a week I have lain in wait. I have now seen two humans, one male, one female, exit the cave, with the wolves close behind. The usual leading wolves are not in the pack."
 toi_wolfwalker.0104.a:0 "I should approach this diplomatically."
 toi_wolfwalker.0104.b:0 "I can challenge the leaders while they are humans!"
 
 toi_wolfwalker.0110.t:0 "A way out"
 toi_wolfwalker.0110.desc:0 "I must leave this den before I am overrun, but the path is blocked by some wolves, with the pack leader among them. This beast thinks he has me trapped and hindered, but I have one last trick. He must die quickly, and the rest will cower and disperse. I pray that my aim is true, and I channel the strength of Lugh as I thrust my spear toward's the mongrel's eyes."
 toi_wolfwalker.0110.a:0 "I will get out!"
 
 toi_wolfwalker.0111.t:0 "Facing the Wolfwalkers"
 toi_wolfwalker.0111.desc:0 "After careful observation of the den, I spot one large wolf whose presence is respected by the others. This is surely the pack leader, and killing him will cause the wolves to disperse. Aiming my bow, the arrow strikes the beast, causing it to yelp in surpised pain. \n\nI move in to cut it down properly, and it's wound will give me a major advantage. It's movements are rough and slow, a clear sign I pierced something important. It's gaze meets mine, I see fury and barely-concealed fear. But something is off about this wolf, it's eyes, they look strangely... human?\n\nNo matter, I will prevail, and remove this beastly scourge from my land for decades to come."
 toi_wolfwalker.0111.a:0 "Time to fight."
 
 toi_wolfwalker.0112.t:0 "Facing the Wolfwalkers"
 toi_wolfwalker.0112.desc:0 "Two wolves challenge me; who can only be the pack leaders. Their shiny teeth and claws match the glint of my sword and spearhead. They are fast, but they are still mere beasts; we enter a savage dance of slash and bite; I focus only on them as I forget everything but my movement. Every movement brings us, or them closer to the grave. As we move, their eyes seem to glow, the only bright spots among their dark fur, and a good target.\n\nIt's time to teach these animals the true masters of this world!"
 toi_wolfwalker.0112.a:0 "May Lugh help me."
 
 toi_wolfwalker.0113.t:0 "Facing the Wolfwalkers"
 toi_wolfwalker.0113.desc:0 "My bravest Ridri and I are advancing towards the den. Two enormous wolves emerge from the den to stop us, but we have them cornered, and I can see the fear in their eyes. This will be no glorious battle, but a massacre.\n\nI almost feel pity for them, but this will be a victory worthy of song!"
 toi_wolfwalker.0113.a:0 "To victory!"
 
 toi_wolfwalker.0114.t:0 "Facing the Wolfwalkers"
 toi_wolfwalker.0114.desc:0 "I have advanced close to both pack leaders, armed with my sword and the element of surprise. With the right timing, one will fall swiftly and the odds will be evened. Even now, they are in shock as they never expected humans to strike at their den.\n\nMy plan is perfect, my hand is steady, I will prevail."
 toi_wolfwalker.0114.a:0 "I shall prevail."
 
 toi_wolfwalker.0120.t:0 "I convinced the Wolfwalkers"
 toi_wolfwalker.0120.desc:0 "The wolves have accepted my plea for communication. As we talked, I learned how to transform into a wolf, their lifestyle, their language, and their leadership. I also shared my styles of leadership with them. This day marks the first of many great collaborations with the Wolfwalkers, as they call themselves. However, I have a choice. They have allowed me to choose whether or not I wish to become a Wolfwalker."
 toi_wolfwalker.0120.a:0 "I should lead my people as one of them."
 toi_wolfwalker.0120.b:0 "This is an opportunity I cannot miss! Attack!"
 toi_wolfwalker.0120.c:0 "We can learn to collaborate and both live in peace."
 
 toi_wolfwalker.0121.t:0 "Failed to convince the Wolfwalkers"
 toi_wolfwalker.0121.desc:0 "All seemed to be going well, we talked for hours. But this was all a ruse. As we spoke, other wolves emerged and surrounded us, and even blocked our path to the exit. We can try to fight or run, but either will be difficult..."
 toi_wolfwalker.0121.a:0 "Now’s the time to run!"
 toi_wolfwalker.0121.b:0 "I’ve got to fight my way out of here!"
 toi_wolfwalker.0121.c:0 "I surrender!"
 
 toi_wolfwalker.0501.t:0 "Peace with the wolves"
 toi_wolfwalker.0501.desc:0 "The agreement that we made with the wolves is being upheld, and both my cattle and subjects alike can rest easy once more without fear of attack. Word of this affair has travelled fast throughout the land, causing my ringfort to develop a reputation for its unmatched safety and has in turn been attracting more travellers and merchants to my domain. "
 toi_wolfwalker.0501.a:0 "Man or beast, all shall heed my word."
 
 toi_wolfwalker.0503.t:0 "The den burns"
 toi_wolfwalker.0503.desc:0 "It has been done. My men sprung in action on my order, swiftly setting the wolves den ablaze before any of the beasts within it had time to realise what was even happening. Their howls of pain eventually faded along with the flames, and all that remains now is silence. "
 toi_wolfwalker.0503.a:0 "The wolves won't bother us anymore."
 
 toi_wolfwalker.0504.t:0 "Uncontrollable fire"
 toi_wolfwalker.0504.desc:0 "On my order, my men set fires around the wolves den. All was going well, until the wind changed direction and caused the fires to spread towards the nearby village instead! While we ran to extinguish it, the wolves emerged from their lair and mauled one of my Ridrí. Before they withdrew, I swear I heard one of the wolves declare that he will have his revenge and no human will be spared."
 toi_wolfwalker.0504.a:0 "What have I done!?"
 
 toi_wolfwalker.0511.t:0 "Victory!"
 toi_wolfwalker.0511.desc:0 "Victory! \n\nThe wolfwalkers have retained some of their human wisdom, as they are fleeing out of my lands. They won't trouble us again or prey on our cattle for several decades. The bards will sing of this great accomplishment!"
 toi_wolfwalker.0511.a:0 "A great day for my lands."
 
 toi_wolfwalker.0512.t:0 "Defeated by the wolves"
 toi_wolfwalker.0512.desc:0 "Despite my best efforts, I underestimated the wolfwalkers. I can hear the screams of my men, then silence as their throats are torn out. But all isn't lost, the exit is unblocked... I just need to escape while I still can..."
 toi_wolfwalker.0512.a:0 "I... must... survive"
 
 toi_wolfwalker.1000.t:0 "Running with the wolves"
 toi_wolfwalker.1000.desc:0 "I don't know what the wolfwalkers did, but it seems to have worked! As I drift to sleep, an otherworldly force fills my body and mind. I close my eyes as a human, then open them as a wolf. In this new form, I am endowed with great strength and vigor, I can commune with and even command other wolves. I can feel the power of the forest flow through and around me, and I feel unstoppable!\n\nAnd yet... I feel strange. Every waking moment as a human, I struggle with beastly urges and instincts. Savage thoughts run through my mind, and sometimes I'm compelled to walk on all fours. I have gained the power of the beast, but at the cost of my humanity. I must be careful and manage my stress, lest I become a monster and lose myself.\n\nI must choose a balance between my outer human and inner wolf. If the beast within devours me, who else will suffer?"
 toi_wolfwalker.1000.a:0 "I am a Wolfwalkers."
 
 toi_wolfwalker.1100.t:0 "My inner wolf"
 toi_wolfwalker.1100.desc:0 "Whenever I eat, the wolf hungers for more. Whenever I drink, the wolf thirsts for more. Whenever I think, the wolf snarls, trying to twist that thought into its own. It is a great risk to unleash it, but can I resist? Should I resist? I do not know but have to choose."
 toi_wolfwalker.1100.a:0 "Unleash the wolf!"
 toi_wolfwalker.1100.b:0 "Balance is the key."
 toi_wolfwalker.1100.c:0 "I have to remain human."
 
 toi_wolfwalker.1500.t:0 "My hungry wolf"
 toi_wolfwalker.1500.desc:0 "The wolf within me got hungry last night, as some Cattle are dead.\n\nThis morning I woke up in a field, covered in blood and viscera. When I returned home I was told my livestock had been brutally slaughtered."
 toi_wolfwalker.1500.a:0 "The beast yearns to be free."
