 toi_scotland_decisions.0001.desc:0 "The work of many years has finally been rewarded. I have founded the empire of The Isles, uniting my formerly divided subjects under a single banner. This achievement will lend its radiance to my dynasty for generations to come, and ensure its bright and glorious future.\n\nThe news has travelled far beyond our borders, reaching ears both high and low. Many new allies have sent their envoys to treat with us, and existing ones have sought to strengthen our bonds of friendship. Still, our vigilance cannot waver. Many new rivals and would-be usurpers have also risen from the shadows, ready to strike at the first sign of weakness. I will stand ready to defend my realm against any who would threaten it, and will lead my newly united people to greatness and prosperity."
