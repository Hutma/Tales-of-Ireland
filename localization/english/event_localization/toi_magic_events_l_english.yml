 toi_magic_event.0001.desc:0 "Even with all my power, my legacy was endangered by fruitless loins. Determined to secure my bloodline, I contacted the Sidhe. \n\nWhat followed was an elaborate ritual where my blood and hair was taken. These pieces of myself were the building materials of a child, molded by the Sidhe's hands. \n\nWhen I awoke the next day, in the corner of my chambers laid a baby wrapped in blankets. Even with their bizarre conception, one look was all it took to know that this was indeed, my child."
