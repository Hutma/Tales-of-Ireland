 introduction_event.010.t:0 "Fomorians, first inhabitants of Ireland"
 introduction_event.010.desc:0 "No one really knows when the first [fomorians|E] came to Ireland, leading some to speculate that they have always been there. The [fomorians|E] are a strong and proud people that praise dark gods and perform ceremonial human sacrifices.\n\nTheir main objective is to purge Ireland of all the new settlers that came thereafter, as they are considered impure. They maintain a tradition of making their enemies pay tribute, taking two third of all their wealth and one of their children regularly until they either die of famine and poverty or leave the island for good."

 introduction_event.002.desc:0 "The Cessarians are the people that followed Cessair, a strong woman who led her people consisting of thirty-nine women and three men to Ireland. They lived here in peace for many centuries and thrived by not taking part in the major wars that have divided Ireland in times past. Some say that the Cessarians can transform themselves into golden salmons like the legendary Fintan mac Bóchra, a very wise Cessarian. \n\nBut now, the fires of war are devastating Ireland as the Milesians are getting invaded by both the Celts and every tribe that was once their vassals. \n\nThe peaceful Cessarians are wealthy...and in time of great trouble this wealth can attract envious and ambitious people to their land. The Cessarians must unite and prepare."

 introduction_event.003.t:0 "Partholonians, the plagued travellers"
 introduction_event.003.desc:0 "The Partholonians travelled all over the world before they settled in Ireland. Before coming to Ireland they lived for at least a century in the North. Because of this their culture and religion is influenced by this. When the Partholonians settled in Ireland they entered in a war against the [fomorians|E]. They won some battles and managed to remain independent most of the time. Free from the [fomorians|E] tyranny, but one day, a strange sickness  began to kill the Partholonians one by one. When the disease finally disappeared, only a handful of Partholonians remained. From this day the Partholonians always served other people until the Celts came and broke the Milesian influence. \n\nNow the Partholonians rise again trying to regain land and wealth for their people."
 
 introduction_event.004.t:0 "Nemedians, Scythian descendents"
 introduction_event.004.desc:0 "The Nemedians came from a far away land, thirty years after the Partholonians. They came from Scythia a land where the sun is always shining, they were led by a man called Nemed. As soon as they settled in Ireland they entered into a constant war with the dominant race of the island, the [fomorians|E]. Eight years of battle resulted in most of them forced to become tributaries of the [fomorians|E], paying them two third of their grain, cattle, milk, children every few years. As a result of this the Nemedians divided themselves into several tribes. A group of them fled Ireland and sailed north, another group fled to the South and the last group of them stayed in Ireland, trying to survive. When the Fir Bolgs defeated the [fomorians|E] many years later, the Nemedians broke free of their overlords and began to thrive. \n\nWith the current wars and political instability, the Nemedians aim to remain independent and, as always, survive."

 introduction_event.005.desc:0 "The Nemedians fled Ireland to settle in Greece, only to be subjugated and enslaved. They became known as the Fir Bolgs, or Men of Bags. Eventually they revolted, gained their freedom and returned to Ireland. After defeating the [fomorians|E], they created the High Kingship, uniting Ireland under one ruler for the first time. Their renewed glory would be short however, as the Tuatha Dé Danann arrived and reduced them to Connacht less than a century later. This has led to lasting animosity between the Fir Bolgs and Tuatha Dé Danann."
 
 introduction_event.006.t:0 "Tuatha Dé Danann, mystical beings"
 introduction_event.006.desc:0 "The Tuatha Dé Danann are descendents of the Nemedians who settle in a land North of Ireland. They thrived there but the gods guided them back to Ireland. In Ireland they defeated the Fir Bolgs who where the overlords of the island at the time and then entered in a war against the [fomorians|E]. They lost the war and the [fomorians|E] became the dominant power, subjugating the Tuatha Dé Danann with a heavy tribute. But one day, a famous warrior named Lugh lead a rebellion against the [fomorians|E] and succeded. \n\nFrom there the Tuatha would rule over Ireland, until... until the arrival of the Milesians. \n\nThe Milesians were fierce warriors and were too numerous for the Tuatha Dé Danann to fight and they defeated them. \n\nAfter this defeat the Tuatha Dé Danann exiled themselves in the Otherworld, the magical plan of the Gods. There, they thrived and became Gods themselves, learning the way of magic and fairies of Ireland. Once day they heared that the Milesians were falling, attacked by a new people named Celts. A part of the  Tuatha Dé Danann tribe decided to leave the Otherworld and recover their past glory. \n\nIn leaving the Otherworld, the godly part of them remained as it could not leave and the Tuatha Dé Danann lost a part of their humanity [question here it's just their godly aspect they lost yeah? If so it would read "lost a part of themselves" but I'll redo this section on clarification.]. It is time  to take restore their past glory."
 
 introduction_event.007.t:0 "Milesians, masters of Ireland"
 introduction_event.007.desc:0 "The Milesians came from Spain, defeated the Tuatha Dé Danann and imposing their rule on every tribe of the island. This would go on for several centuries. They developed the land and ensured peace between every tribe. Their power was absolute. \n\nBut, at last, a decade ago, the Celtic people arrived to Ireland, defying their authority. The Milesians had fought several wars but the Celts seemed unbeatable. This was the beginning of the Milesian fall, all tribes broke free from their authority, one by one. \n\nEven if they still hold on the High Kingship and the kingdom of Tara, every one knows that this will not last for long. The Milesian must stand and fight, or see their legacy destroyed..."
 
 introduction_event.008.t:0 "Celts, the new tribes"
 introduction_event.008.desc:0 "The Celtic people grew stronger every year for the past few decades until they revolted against the Milesians, against the High King. The revolt was the most successful one ever seen. Ireland quickly became politically fractured and the Celts were the strongest of these groups. But with this newly acquired freedom the celtic tribes did not stayed united. Now chaos reigns supreme, every tribe trys to subjugate the other. \n\nIt's a time of chaos, and the Celts must prevail."

 introduction_event.009.desc:0 "The Bell Beakers and other ancient cultures that built the Monoliths of Ireland, such as Newgrange, have witnessed the arrival of other people, other tribes, one by one. These ancient humans tried to fight against them at first but without much success. Because of that they lost their territory, piece by piece. Now they have been reduced to a shadow of their former selves with then reatining a fraction of their former territory, and their sacred sites are occupied by foreigners. \n\nWith the recent fall of the Milesians overlords, it is time for them to break free and reclaim their sacred places."
 
 introduction_event.011.t:0 "Development, the Cattle system"
 introduction_event.011.desc:0 "In Tales Of Ireland the development represent the amount of Cattle a county has. \n \nAt the time Cattle was the main source of power and most wars were fought over cattle. \n \nEvery year an event will affect the Cattle in your capital county. The bonus given by Cattle is three times more important than in the base game. \n\nBe wary, when a county is occupied it loses between one and three Cattle and when a title is lost to another character by war it lose one Cattle."

 introduction_event.013.desc:0 "In this mod the average levies that a ruler have is approximately eight times smaller, the men at arms regiment size is four times smaller and the knight power is three times smaller. \n \nThat means that men at arms are even more important than before and that knights are even more important than that. \n \nThis way, a very successful count can beat a king with the right assets. \n \n #S Work in progress : Also note that wars can be solved by a duel between two champions, one for each side, refusing a duel or going against its outcome is badly perceived.#!"
