 toi_otherworld_exploration.2001.desc: "Suddenly I find myself on an island, the air feels crisp and refreshing, and the sun shines bright but sensuously.

 toi_otherworld_exploration.2002.desc: "I've arrived in a fantastical place; the azure skies flow like the waves on the banks of the Irish shores. Persistently the clouds sweep back and forth as if gently caressed by an unseen tide.\n\nThe ground itself is glimmering green like emeralds. Across its landscape are collapsed fortresses and castles, like a treasure trove never breached by others."

 toi_otherworld_exploration.2005.desc: "The strangest thing I've seen in the Otherworld is a land that is anything but. It can best be described as an orchard; lonely trees planted far apart, each growing golden apples. Flocks of swans roam about, but no-one and nothing else is here.\nI almost thought I was still in Ireland, but the mystical swaying of the island, like a boat rocking on water, reminded me where I was.\n\nThe near-lack of extravagance and wonder doesn't calm, but instead creeps me out. Why would such a mundane land be deep in the Otherworld? Who or what is maintaining this orchard, and why?"

Bright lights shine in the distance, but there's no tellng whether they'll help or hinder.\n\nEveryone knows that parts of the Otherworld harbor the deceased, but the stories didn't prepare me for the real thing. I can see my friends I've lost and my ancestors among them, but I can't stay here. Those who spend too much time here can never leave, and join the dead.\n\nIt is said that the destiny of all is written here by the Sidhe. Perhaps being in this library of lives, I can rewrite my own?"

He was once a Cessarian, among the first people to reach Ireland. \n\nSeeing me, he shrinks himself down to a more manageable size.
