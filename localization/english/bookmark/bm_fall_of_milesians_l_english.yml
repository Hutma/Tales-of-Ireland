 bm_fall_of_milesians_desc:0 "For centuries the Milesians have ruled over Ireland and all its inhabitants. Their hegemony, however, is about to be challenged. A new threat has been landing on their shores: men from the continent. Without the numbers or unity to face this challenge the Milesians grow weaker by the year, and the tribes they once dominated begin to stir with hearts filled of thoughts of revenge. Perhaps sensing instability, or perhaps by fate alone, the Tuatha Dé Danann have been seen rising from the Otherworld to challenge Milesians and Fomorians alike. Eire is fragmented. \n\nWill there ever again emerge a leader capable of uniting their people and the island?#!"

His hold on the island is tenuous at best, with his rule further hindered by the machinations of his brothers. Words of conspiracy whisper through the halls of his ringfort in Tara while Lóegaire plots a path to regain control, and if he’s lucky, glory.#!"

Though his kingdom has been stable under his rule, many pretenders eye his throne with envy. Should Rudraige quell the quibbling chiefs on his border, the former glory of the Fir Bolgs will surely be restored.#!"

Hearing of the recent Milesian struggle against the Celts, Nuada has lead his people back to the mortal realms to exact his revenge. With a small troop he has conquered Derry from his ancient enemies, the Fomorians. Using the mystical powers he learned in the Otherworld, it will be difficult for any force to resist his revenge.#!"

King Inzhay has followed in the footsteps of his people and his ancestors: he burns with a fierce hatred of all the interlopers and invaders of his island. Nothing but slaughter and brutal enslavement will sate his ire, and with the dark magic known only to his people, all of Ireland will learn once more the meaning of fear.#!"
