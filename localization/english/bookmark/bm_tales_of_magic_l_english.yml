Sorcerers, otherworldly Sidhe, and little known creatures roam the island, seeking their ambitions.\nHowever, a new regime is beginning. The time has come for those attuned to magic to impose their rightful hegemony over this fair isle.\nIn the south, the Wolfwalkers exact their revenge on those who desecrate their woods. And yet, more deadly beings roam. Not beasts, not man, nor forest, nor any of nature’s spawn. These immortal beings hunt blood to sustain their unnatural life, and the strongest of them now wakes. Abhartach has regained control over his homeland, and seeks to expand his otherworldly domain across Ireland."

 bookmark_tales_of_magic_abhartach_desc: "This Abhartach was a dwarf, a magician, and a dreadful tyrant, and after having perpetrated great cruelties on the people he was at last vanquished and slain by a neighbouring chieftain; some say by Fionn Mac Cumhail. He was buried in a standing posture, but the very next day he appeared in his old haunts, more cruel and vigorous than ever. And the chief slew him a second time and buried him as before, but again he escaped from the grave, and spread terror through the whole country. The chief then consulted a druid, and according to his directions, he slew the dwarf a third time, and buried him in the same place, with his head downwards; which subdued his magical power, so that he never again appeared on earth."

 bookmark_tales_of_magic_droch_fhuil_desc: "Droch-Fhuil's talents led him to become a legendary magician, and he built a vast and mighty empire in the south of Ireland. But his curiosity and ambition was as deep as the oceans, which led him to seek power in new sources. He conducted several expeditions into the Otherworld, gaining all manner of occult and exotic knowledge.\nBut one fateful day, he failed to return from Otherworld. He spent a while the forbidden realms before finding a way out, but he found a changed world. What had been a few years in the Otherworld was centuries to the outside. His old empire had collapsed in his absence, and new invader groups had claimed his land.\nAll that remained was his old castle of Dun Droch-Fhola. From here is his opportunity to take back what is rightfully his. Has the past come back to haunt the people of Munster? Or will Droch-Fhuil be history, just like his empire?"

A Lord became obsessed with such rumors, starting and leading a years-long hunt to find and destroy them. His son Liam protested, believing they meant no harm and could even help them.\nAlas, the Lord continued the hunt; and when he discovered the Wolfwalker's den, they descended on the party and slaughtered them. Liam was gravely wounded, but the Wolfwalkers, knowing the mercy Liam had shown, saved his life by granting him the same powers.\nNow the tales speak of a Wolf Lord; by day a Ruler, by night a Wolf. Liam has always struggled, will he hold on to his humanity or be consumed by the beast that lies within?"

His unique gifts let him spearhead the Celtic invasion into Ireland, and many of his brothers regarded him as a hero. But with this power came ambition; Aaron wasn't satisfied with being a mere Court Mage, he carved out land for himself and became one of the youngest Celtic Rulers in Ireland.\nSurrounded by mundane fools, he sees not enemies, but opportunity in every direction. Will his power let him rise above the Celts and the other invader groups? Or will his overconfidence cause an untimely end?"

He was born with unique talents, and has honed them through his whole life. The time is at hand; Fearn would now rather break than bend. Will his people taste freedom once again?"
