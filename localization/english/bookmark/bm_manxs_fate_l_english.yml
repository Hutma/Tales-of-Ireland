 bm_manxs_fate:0 "Mannin's Fate"
 bm_manxs_fate_desc:0 "In the last centuries the island of Mannin witnessed the arrival of many newcomers. The native Bann culture of the island  welcomed Nemedians fleeing Ireland and the Fomorian cruelties. The Nemedians lived in peace with the Bann culture for decades until Celtic tribes from Britain immigrated to the island. The Bann people did not welcome them peacefully but had to yield the eastern part of the island, using the Cursed Forest of Barrule as the boundary between their realms. The Nemedians were given land between the two rival cultures to act as a buffer. A century of peace graced Mannin\n\nThen, Fir Bolgs sailed there after their defeat against the Tuatha Dé Danann. The Fir Bolgs seized the sourthern part of the land from the Bann people. For a thousand years each tribe tried to unite Mannin but all failed. Each generation is more eager to go to war than the previous one and tension is rising again between the tribes of Mannin. The arrival of a new adventurer dreaming of war and conquests, Fuirechtach of the Dal Riata, might cause conflicts to flare up and reshape the fate of Mannin."

Unlike most, he succeeded, yet his sons, their sons and beyond have done little to raise us higher as rival warlords gather their strength. This affront to our ways must be corrected. We are Fir Bolg, and we promised to never bow again; not in Ireland, nor in Mannin."

Even after, they couldn't push us off the island, and the names of our warlords were the names of a new fear.\n\nWe may have lost our former glory, but so has our enemies. This is our chance to rebuild, and I shall finish what my ancestors started."

 bookmark_manxs_fate_endelient_desc:0 "Long ago, our people fled Ireland amid the Fomorian terror. My ancestors came to Mannin, and served as great warriors for Bann against the Brythons in exchange for a new home. Time has withered and broken this bond, now we find ourselves truly alone.\n\nThe world has fallen into chaos. If we are to survive, we must secure Mannin for ourselves."

 bookmark_manxs_fate_clemens_desc:0 "Once, our fair island was a peaceful and prosperous land. Even the mighty kings of Ireland and Britain dared not to provoke us. But we grew lazy and weak. Bit by bit, our home has been claimed by strangers from across the sea, and now the earth is drowned in blood.\n\nThe time of compliance and peace is over. Now they will know why their ancestors feared us! Mannin will be ours once again!"
