Many battles were fought, but the [partholonians|E] were able to maintain their independence and place on the island. \n\nSome time after their conflict with the [fomorians|E] ended the [partholonians|E] began to fall sick and perish, one by one. By the time the disease had ran its course, only a handful of [partholonians|E] remained.

Originally hailing from the far away land of Scythia, where the sun is said to always be shining, their people were once led by a man called Nemed. Not long after settling, the [nemedians|E] quickly found themselves at odds with the dominant [fomorians|E]. Eight years of bitter war resulted in Nemedian subjugation, and their tribe became tributaries of the [fomorians|E], paying them two thirds of their grain, cattle, milk, children every few years. With many unable to survive under such harsh conditions, many [nemedians|E] fled Ireland, with some sailing north and others fleeing to far away lands in the south, such as Greece. \n\nMany years later, the [fomorians|E] were defeated by the Fir Bolg, which gave the [nemedians|E] the opportunity to break free from their weakened overlords, and thrived with their independence. Now, the developing [nemedians|E] struggle to survive and remain free as instability plagues Ireland and the fires of war are stoked once more."

They crowned their rule the [high_kingship|E], uniting Ireland under one ruler for the first time. Their renewed glory was not meant to last, however, as the conquering [de_danann|E] arrived and pushed them all the way back to Connacht less than a century later.

After their defeat, the [de_danann|E] found themselves subjugated by the [fomorians|E] with a harsh tribute, just as their ancestors had been. \n\nAfter years of enslavement, a famous warrior named Lugh rose up and lead a rebellion against the [fomorians|E], once again bringing the [de_danann|E] into power, where they would again rule over Ireland... until the arrival of the [milesians|E]. \n\nThe [milesians|E] were fierce warriors and proved too numerous for the [de_danann|E]. Upon their defeat, the [de_danann|E] exiled themselves to the [otherworld|E], the mysterious realm of the gods. In the Otherworld they thrived and became gods themselves, learning the ways of magic and gaining knowledge from the fairies of Ireland.\n\n After hearing that the [milesians|E] were weakening under attacks by a new people called [celts|E], a faction of the [de_danann|E] tribe decided to leave the [otherworld|E] in an attempt to recover their past glory.

Their power was absolute... \n\nBut, at last, only a decade ago, the Celtic people arrived at the shores of Ireland, disrupting their authority. The [milesians|E] were no stranger to war, but the [celts|E] seemed impossible to defeat. This signaled the beginning of the Milesian fall, and every each tribe who was once a tributary to the Milesians have since rebelled. \n\nEven if the [milesians|E] still claim the title of [high_kingship|E] and the Kingdom of Tara, many believe this will not last for long. \n\nThe milesians|E] must stand and fight to reclaim what was theirs, or see their legacy destroyed."

Gaining Irish wealth and territory for themselves, the Celtic saw no use for maintaining unity, and splintered into rival groups.
