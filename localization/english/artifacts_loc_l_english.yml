 artifact_create.0008.desc:0 "I've called for a suitable blacksmith to be summoned before me for the task, but first I need to decide how far I am willing to go, and what exactly I want. Some new armor might help present me as the splitting image of rulership I am, while a new weapon would no doubt be of use in battle and possibly outside of it. Then again, I could always use some new fineries..."

 artifact_create.0001.desc_crown:0 "Armor! Beautiful armor! Or at least functional, now the only question is how much exactly I spend. I could do something truly grand, but obviously I ultimately have to worry about the finances, and there's no promise that if I spend the treasury that what I receive will be entirely worth the investment..."
 artifact_create.0001.desc_jewelry:0 "Some fineries, a staff, crown and jewelry, to show everyone my regalia. Nothing to skimp out on, but such things can be surprisingly expensive. Getting something grand will no doubt impress the court, but bankruptcy is probably not in fashion at the moment..."
 artifact_create.0001.a:0 "Just something functional is all I need."

What’s more, we may be able to improve the item, with your support. With your approval, we are prepared to begin further work immediately." As I listened to the craftsman’s words, I considered my options carefully."

 artifact_create.0004.desc:0 "A representative from my smiths is hurried before me and, against my initial hopes, he brings poor news.\n\n"M'lord..." he starts. "I... well my assistant, no good lad, Meldrick, the little simpleton... well... well we were going to..." what comes next is a long tirade of complaints and excuses which simply informs me that the item my smiths had been commissioned to create has come out of far poorer quality than intially hoped, and I have the sneaking feeling that Meldrick is simply a fallman for a greater bout of incompetence. I could let them simply continue on, or I could fire the lot of them and spend the coin to get someone hopefully more competent."
 artifact_create.0004.a:0 "What can we salvage here?"
 artifact_create.0004.a.success:0 "The smiths manage to undo the damage"

 artifact_create.0006.t:0 "State of my Work"
 artifact_create.0006.improve.desc:0 "While the initial designs were adequate, adequacy is not the place for one of my stature! I have put my smiths to work on some potential upgrades that I have been informed of, with the hopes that the final result can be further improved from initial designs at a minimum cost... and, well...\n\nThe result has left me giddy beyond measure! The item is apparently far beyond even my wildest expectations, and it should come out even better than I initially hoped!"
 artifact_create.0006.degrade.desc:0 "While the initial designs were adequate, but adequacy is not the place for one of my stature! I have put my smiths to work on some potential upgrades that I have been informed of, with the hopes that the final result can be further improved from initial designs at a minimum cost... and, well...\n\n The result has been disappointing, with the reports from my smiths indicating that the attempted improvements have actually degraded the quality of the work. It seems the winds of fate have not been kind to me."
 artifact_create.0006.fallback.desc:0 "While the initial designs were adequate, but adequacy is not the place for one of my stature! I have put my smiths to work on some potential upgrades that I have been informed of, with the hopes that the final result can be further improved from initial designs at a minimum cost... and, well...\n\nThe result has been adequate, with the initial reports indicating improvements in several key areas."
 artifact_create.0006.a:0 "An acceptable outcome. Let us complete the design…"
 artifact_create.0006.b:0 "Rats! Let us complete the design..."
 
 artifact_create.0007.t:0 "An even better creation?"
 artifact_create.0007.desc:0 "As I have eagerly awaited news from my smiths, I have begun to wonder, is great enough? Would it not be possible to put in some extra effort, and create an item truly worthy of the ages? Perhaps it won't be that great, but something truly inspiring. If I just... demanded some effort, put in more funding, put in more time, perhaps we could reach some dizzying new heights of craftsmanship. There's always the risk, however, that the finished product may be worse off. Any modifications made through the smithing process carries this risk, and asking for blacksmiths to give me the sun and stars may end up having the opposite effect. The decision, as always, is mine and mine alone."
 artifact_create.0007.a:0 "We can go further..."
 artifact_create.0007.a.tt:0 "I will try and produce a Rarity 4 artifact."
 artifact_create.0007.b:0 "I should stop here. What I had commissioned was perfectly acceptable."
 
 artifact_create.0008.t:0 "What to make, what to make..."
 artifact_create.0008.desc:0 "Now I need to decide what type of artifact I want exactly. Perhaps a sword to show the nobility of my rank... or perhaps a suit of armor, that may be more useful in certain other situations. I could even commission a set a beautiful crown jewels to impress everyone in my court."
 artifact_create.0008.a:0 "A deadly weapon!"
 artifact_create.0008.a.tt:0 "The finished artifact will be a weapon."
 artifact_create.0008.b:0 "A suit of armor!"
 artifact_create.0008.b.tt:0 "The finished artifact will be armor."

 artifact_create.0008.d:0 "On second thought, maybe not."

 artifact_create.0009.t:0 "The Work Completed"
 artifact_create.0009.desc:0 "As my smiths approach, flanked by guardsmen, they carry with them the sealed case carrying the item I commissioned what seems so long ago. My throat tightens, has all of the efforts been for naught? Will I carry with me the first of a true artifact that shall be passed, rightfully cherished, down my family line for generations to come? The thoughts race through my mind as with shaking hands I unclasp the seals and find..."
 artifact_create.0009.a:0 "A stunning success! A true artifact!"
 artifact_create.0009.a.tt:0 "A perfect adequate, just as I wished for!"
 artifact_create.0009.b:0 "A dismal failure! Damn it all!"
 artifact_create.0009.c:0 "Nothing. Useless junk."

 artifact_hunt.0001.t:0 "The Hunt Begins"
 artifact_hunt.0001.desc:0 "Through my recent exploits I have come across evidence of a possible item that has lain hidden to historians for some time. Of course, it could all be just a fanciful rumor, old wives' tales, or possibly even outright fabrications. Still, on the chance chat these whispers are true, I would be foolish to pass up the opportunity. Artifacts of historical note can be of massive value to those with an eye for it, and any ruler possessing one would no doubt be the talk of the land for much time to come. My mind fills with images of magnificent helms, gleaming and gilded swords, and breastplates beaten by only the most skilled hands of history. I feel as if I am holding them all even now..."
 artifact_hunt.0001.a:0 "Time to go hunting!"
 artifact_hunt.0001.b:0 "Maybe some other time."
 
 artifact_hunt.0002.t:0 "Hired Help"
 artifact_hunt.0002.desc:0 "Why should I bother chasing down leads on what very well turn out to be a wild goose chase? I have so much more important, patently real issues to handle at court. I simply can't spare any time to personally look into rumors. That doesn't mean I have to ignore them however, because to do so could prove quite foolish indeed. Instead of heading out myself I have decided to hire some locals to do the searching for me. Hunters, trappers, veterans of past wars, people who ought to know the lay of the land. They'll be good and trustworthy as long as I pay them a fair amount in exchange for finding the artifact."
 artifact_hunt.0002.a:0 "Good luck!"
 artifact_hunt.0002.b:0 "Perhaps I should save my gold for a more certain endeavor."
 
 artifact_hunt.0003.t:0 "The Ranging"
 artifact_hunt.0003.desc:0 "Any good leader must be willing to get his hands dirty in the pursuit of glory and power, or so the storytellers have told us. Today, I will lead a ranging of my personal retinue to search for the supposedly nearby artifact. The party will be broken up into pairs and sent to canvass as wide an area as is possible. Hopefully the excursion will prove to be a swift one, and without any interference from man, beast, or darker entity. The hunt has not been outfitted for heavy combat, and our main advantage will be out speed. With any luck I shall return home by tomorrow at the latest, my new artifact by my side."
 artifact_hunt.0003.a:0 "We ride!"
 artifact_hunt.0003.b:0 "I have other battles to win."
 
 artifact_hunt.0004.t:0 "Cutting A Deal"
 artifact_hunt.0004.desc:0 "Apparently the artifact I've been looking for has actually found its way into the hands of a minor neighboring noble. They might not be so willing to just part with it, even for a good sum of coin. Of course, seeing as how I am the dominant lord in this region, I could exert my power as well as my own personal charm in order to get them to budge. Should that prove not enough, I could go a step further and resort to threats and cajoling. I just hope they'll listen to reason before it comes to anything so brutish."
 artifact_hunt.0004.a:0 "Time to dash off an invitation."
 artifact_hunt.0004.b:0 "Perhaps I should save my gold for a more certain endeavor."
 
 artifact_hunt.0005.t:0 "Hitting The Scrolls"
 artifact_hunt.0005.desc:0 "Searching around aimlessly might be well and good for the common folk, but I am above such wastes of time! I've found bits and pieces of information regarding the artifact rumored to be nearby. By analyzing the clues left behind in these ancient tomes and scrolls, I can significantly narrow down the possible resting place of my target, making the most difficult part of this task all the simpler. Once I have decoded the location, I can simply dispatch some scholars with skills in archeology to secure my new prize."
 artifact_hunt.0005.a:0 "Now which scroll was it?"
 artifact_hunt.0005.b:0 "On second thought, this will likely be a pointless endeavor."
 
 artifact_hunt.0006.t:0 "A Bureaucratic Break"
 artifact_hunt.0006.desc:0 "My steward has brought me word of a most fortunate development in my search for the artifact! It seems that local records may hold the key to retrieving my target. Of course, many of these documents are quite dense and will require careful reading and cross-referencing if I am to secure an understanding of them. My steward has pledged to help me discern some of the possible ciphers and codes he believes were hidden away in these records. Still, given how hard someone has worked to keep this treasure hidden, I cannot be certain we will be able to find success."
 artifact_hunt.0006.a:0 "Get me an abacus."
 artifact_hunt.0006.b:0 "Maybe a shall wait for a rainy day to crack this mystery."
 
 artifact_hunt.0007.t:0 "Benevolent Compulsion"
 artifact_hunt.0007.desc:0 "As I finish my hunt, the success of it bringing me great joy, a certain strange feeling overtakes me. It is not an unpleasant feeling, rather being like a warm compulsion, pulling me towards something unknown. I turn from my path and walk towards the mysterious and unfamiliar force drawing me somewhere else. Inevitably, I reach the place it was trying to bring me, finding a certain object where the pull is strongest, at which point the feeling vanishes."
 artifact_hunt.0007.a:0 "Perhaps this was fate..."
 artifact_hunt.0007.b:0 "Maybe some things are best left alone..."
 
 artifact_hunt.0008.t:0 "No Luck"
 artifact_hunt.0008.desc:0 "Despite my best efforts, the search for what could have been a legendary artifact has turned up naught. Whether it was from my own failings or the others I enlisted, the trail has gone cold."
 artifact_hunt.0008.a:0 "What a shame."

 ### Artifacts
 
 artifact_4_name:0 "Longsword"
 artifact_4_desc:0 "Although the sword is one of the most common weapons in the world, this one is a bit uncommon. It is a bit shinier, a bit flashier, a bit more durable than those around it, on account of its better forging by a talented smith. But whether this makes the wielder a bit better at killing foes depends entirely on who's wielding it."
 artifact_4_modifier:0 "Longsword"
 
 artifact_5_name:0 "Fine Longsword"
 artifact_5_desc:0 "Anyone with a sharp eye who looks at this sword can tell it is of good make, and it bears the mark of a locally renowned blacksmith at the base of the blade. Although it lacks the ornamentation of some ceremonial weapons, its materials are high-quality and it is a boon to any skilled fighter who wields it."
 artifact_5_modifier:0 "Fine Longsword"
 
 artifact_6_name:0 "Sword of Heroes"
 artifact_6_desc:0 "This sword has a regal air about it, combining a well-sharpened and polished blade with a gilded hilt and a decorated scabbard. Whether wielded by a seasoned swordsman, a renowned knight, or a stately lord, this weapon seems suited for the hands of a truly skilled individual."
 artifact_6_modifier:0 "Sword of Heroes"
 
 artifact_7_name:0 "Sword of Legends"
 artifact_7_desc:0 "This sword seems to exude a sense of #EMP greatness!#! Just seeing it causes the imagination to conjure up images of valiant knights slaying dragons, noble kings charging into battle, and legendary duelists slicing opponents to ribbons. Even if it may not have been forged by a god or wielded by a saint, it certainly looks the part."
 artifact_7_modifier:0 "Sword of Legends"
 
 artifact_8_name:0 "Silver Crown"
 artifact_8_desc:0 "A simple but elegant silver crown, this simple but aesthetically pleasing headpiece is a symbol of an individual's wealth and prestige. Only those with status and renown would wear this in public."
 artifact_8_modifier:0 "Silver Crown"
 
 artifact_9_name:0 "Ruby Crown"
 artifact_9_desc:0 "Inlaid with silver and rubies, this ancient artifact was crafted by talented artisans from the lands of Rira. This crown is worth a small fortune, and one can be sure that whoever's head this diadem rests on is both extremely wealthy and powerful."
 artifact_9_modifier:0 "Ruby Crown"
 
 artifact_10_name:0 "Golden Crown"
 artifact_10_desc:0 "This fine crown is wrought from a dark red gold, with the finest ivory, as well as a multitude of expensive stones and gems. The quality is impeccable; only those of great status and power are worthy of wearing such a prestigious artifact."
 artifact_10_modifier:0 "Golden Crown"
 
 artifact_11_name:0 "Crown of Legends"
 artifact_11_desc:0 "Crafted from the hands of a master smith, platinum and gold are interweaved flawlessly into this visually stunning crown. Gems and diamonds glitter are inlined around the whole of this priceless artifact. A one of a kind artifact, this crown is worthy for only the most wealthy and powerful of rulers."
 artifact_11_modifier:0 "Crown of Legends"
 
 artifact_12_name:0 "Crown Jewels"
 artifact_12_desc:0 "These crown jewels are shining and certainly valuable, but were crafted without too much skill. Nevertheless, they effectively contribute to the awe inspired by their owner."
 artifact_12_modifier:0 "Crown Jewels"
 
 artifact_13_name:0 "Fine Crown Jewels"
 artifact_13_desc:0 "This set of crown jewels was skillfully crafted and are somewhat remarkable to look upon. This shows the power held by their owner in an effective yet subdued manner."
 artifact_13_modifier:0 "Fine Crown Jewels"
 
 artifact_14_name:0 "Remarkable Crown Jewels"
 artifact_14_desc:0 "This jewelry was created masterfully and essentially without flaw, they are truly incredible to behold. This shows the power they represent such that none can deny it."
 artifact_14_modifier:0 "Remarkable Crown Jewels"
 
 artifact_15_name:0 "Regal Crown Jewels"
 artifact_15_desc:0 "These gems are breathtakingly beautiful and legendary beyond what words can express, they shine so bright their owner may as well possess the sky itself."
 artifact_15_modifier:0 "Regal Crown Jewels"
 
 artifact_16_name:0 "Sharpened Axe"
 artifact_16_desc:0 "Since the dawn of metallurgy, axes' basic designs have changed little throughout human history: a sharpened metal head affixed to a wooden handle. And this axe is no different. It may not look much fancier than the average forester's tool, but it can cut through bone as easily as it cuts wood."
 artifact_16_modifier:0 "Sharpened Axe"
 
 artifact_17_name:0 "Ornate Axe"
 artifact_17_desc:0 "Forged from good castle steel and with a sturdy wooden handle, this axe is a cut above the rest. It is perfectly capable of serving as a skilled fighter's weapon on the battlefield, and it certainly has the nicks and scars to prove it."
 artifact_17_modifier:0 "Ornate Axe"
 
 artifact_18_name:0 "Gilded Axe"
 artifact_18_desc:0 "This axe strikes a fine balance between utility and ceremony; its head is engraved with elaborate motifs, and its polished wood handle shines in the sunlight. However, that makes it no less capable of killing a foe. A fine weapon for a ruler who values both beauty and brutality."
 artifact_18_modifier:0 "Gilded Axe"
 
 artifact_19_name:0 "Masterwork Axe"
 artifact_19_desc:0 "This axe is a marvel to behold, with a head decorated by gold filigree, a silver-plated handle, and a grip lined with precious stones. Many who see it pause for a moment and pity that such beautiful handiwork would be brought to such an ugly place as a battlefield—right until its owner buries it in their skulls."
 artifact_19_modifier:0 "Masterwork Axe"
 
 artifact_20_name:0 "Fine Lance"
 artifact_20_desc:0 "This lance is of fine quality, it is not overly special in any particular way, serving simply as a good, solid weapon fit for nobility. One would be quite satisfied to ride into battle wielding this, though it would most likely not be the flashiest item on display in battle."
