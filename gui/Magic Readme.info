##### Implementation ######
### 1. How to implement this
# You should just be able to copy the contents of the folder into your mod folder. There may be some files that you will have to overwrite but they will all be edited versions of what you already have, and you should be able to replace all files.

### 2. Finalizing the system
# You will need to add the effects of the spells to 'common/scripted_guis/magic_scripted_gui.txt' and the requirements in 'common/scripted_triggers/magic_base_triggers.txt'
# You will also need to add the specific magic usage for said spells in 'common/script_values/magic_cost_values.txt'
# I would edit the magician traits
# There are three categories per spells: those which target you, those which target other people, and those which target titles. If you want to change what's in each category, it's in scripted_effects. Just change the list it's added to.

##### Additions #####
### 3. How to add a new spell to the system
# In 'common/scripted_effects/magic_base_effects.txt' add an entry to one of the category lists
# Add a name for said spell in 'localization/english/magic_gui_|_english.yml'
# In 'common/script_values/magic_cost_values.txt' add an entry for the magic usage of the spell
# Add the requirements for the spell in 'common/scripted_triggers/magic_base_triggers.txt'
# Finally, in 'common/scripted_guis/magic_scripted_gui.txt' add an entry for your new spell. I suggest just copy an existing one and edit as needed
